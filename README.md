Automatic Stairs Lighting System

This project implements an automatic stairs lighting system using Arduino. The system is designed to illuminate the stairs when someone approaches them and turn off when they leave. It utilizes infrared sensors to detect the presence of a person.

Features:
Automatically turns on the lights when someone approaches the stairs.
Turns off the lights when the person leaves the stairs.
Adjustable delay for the lights to remain on after the person has left.
Low power consumption through the use of sleep modes when the system is inactive.

Hardware Requirements:
Arduino Uno or compatible board
Infrared sensors (e.g., IR proximity sensors)
LEDs or lighting strips for illumination
Resistors
Breadboard or custom PCB for prototyping
Connecting wires
